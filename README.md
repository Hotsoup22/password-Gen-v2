# password-Gen-v2

## Description

basic: html, css, javascript

password generator attempt 2

Motivated by how much help I needed the first attempt at making this password-gen. i thought about giving it another try. using javascript, css (w/ bootsrap), html. generate random passwords based on criteria that is selected. The app run's in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The Interface also adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Usage

- Select desired characters for password.
- Enter desired Password-Length.
- Generate Button to start.
